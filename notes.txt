--> Solace & Event Brokers :: Concepts:

- Events:
an event represents a change in the state of data.such as a sensor signaling a change in temperature, a field changing in a database,a bank deposit being completed.Often, the sooner an enterprise knows about an event and can react, the better.

- Messages:
A message is simply a communication of data. In an EDA, messages communicate data about events.Messaging lets computer systems share information without requiring direct connections or awareness of each others location. Messaging is analogous to postal and shipping services.

- What are Endpoints
Topic endpoints are used when the message is intended to be consumed by more than one subscriber. 

- What are exchange patterns or exchange mechanism
Defines the sequence and cardinality of messages sent between the provider and the consumer.
